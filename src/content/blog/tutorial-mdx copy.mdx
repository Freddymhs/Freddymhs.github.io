what is MDX?

MDX is a file extension that allows you to write JSX in your markdown files. It's a great way to add React components to your blog posts.

Here's an example of how you can use MDX in your blog post:

```mdx
import React from 'react';

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

When you save this file with the `.mdx` extension, the React component will be rendered as HTML in your blog post.

MDX also allows you to import other files, such as images or CSS stylesheets, and use them in your blog post.

```mdx
import myImage from './my-image.jpg';           
import './my-styles.css';

<img src={myImage} alt="My image" />
``` 

You can also use JSX expressions in your MDX files. For example, you can use variables or functions in your blog post.

```mdx
const myVariable = 'Hello, world!';

<p>{myVariable}</p>
```

MDX also allows you to use React components in your blog post. For example, you can use a custom component to display a quote.

```mdx
import Quote from './Quote';

<Quote text="Hello, world!" />
```

In this example, the `Quote` component is imported from a separate file and used in the blog post.

You can also use JSX expressions and React components in your MDX files. For example, you can use variables or functions in your blog post.

```mdx
const myVariable = 'Hello, world!';

<p>{myVariable}</p>
```

In this example, the `myVariable` variable is used in the blog post.

You can also use JSX expressions and React components in your MDX files. For example, you can use variables or functions in your blog post.

```mdx
const myVariable = 'Hello, world!';

<p>{myVariable}</p>
